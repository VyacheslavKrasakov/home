I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
